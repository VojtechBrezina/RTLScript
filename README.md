# RTLScript

This scripting language is written from right to left. 
It is designed to make your eyes hurt if you are a true coder. 
On the other hand, it is tuing complete and going to have a nice library for all kinds of tasks.
In the future it might have a basic game library.

## Writing RTLScript programs
### Basic syntax
- every line ends with a command
- before that there are any arguments the command needs
- commands and expressions are not separated by anything
- string literals are closed in double qotes ""
- reading a variable is done by [] (the variable name is the result of any expression inside the brackes, even a number)
- when a command needs an undefined number of arguments, the argument list is followed by END (DNE i the script)
- DNE is also used to terminate a block of commands
